I am a second year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Dr. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) at the [Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab](https://dmml.asu.edu/home)  the School of CS & AI, Arizona State University. My current research projects and interests include contrastive representation learning for text, improving language model generation capabilities and building generalizable detectors for machine generated text. I am also interested in developing and building solutions for real-world use cases involving continual learning of tasks over time, and low-resource, label scarce learning settings.

Currently, I am interning as a Software Systems Research Intern at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref).
