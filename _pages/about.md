# Hi there!

I am a fourth year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Dr. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) at the [Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab](https://dmml.asu.edu/home) at the School of CS & AI, Arizona State University. My current research primarily focuses on: (i) leveraging large language models (LLMs) for human-intensive tasks in a machine learning pipeline, (ii) robust detection of AI-generated content, and (iii) NLP applications in domain adaptation and domain generalization. During the summer of 2022, I interned at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) as a Software Systems Research Intern, under the guidance of Buvaneswari Ramanan and Thomas Woo, where I worked on problems in the realm of continual learning and low-resource learning in real-world use-cases. 
When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, hiking, kayaking, camping and chilling with my cat Luna!
