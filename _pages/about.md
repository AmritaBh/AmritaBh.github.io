# Hi there!

I am a final year Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Dr. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) at the [Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab](https://dmml.asu.edu/home) at the School of CS & AI, Arizona State University. My current research primarily focuses on: (i) leveraging large language models (LLMs) for human-intensive tasks in a machine learning pipeline, (ii) robust detection of AI-generated content, and (iii) NLP applications in domain adaptation and domain generalization. During the summer of 2024, I was an Applied Research Intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) [NeMo Guardrails](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-chatbot-guardrails-nemo/), working with Christopher Parisien and Shaona Ghosh, on inference-time safety steering of large language models(LLMs). During the summer of 2022, I interned at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) as a Software Systems Research Intern, under the guidance of Buvaneswari Ramanan and Thomas Woo, where I worked on problems in the realm of continual learning and low-resource learning in real-world use-cases. 
When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, hiking, kayaking, camping and chilling with my cat Luna!
