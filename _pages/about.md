I am a second year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Dr. Subbarao Kambhampati](https://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/) in [Yochan Lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) at the School of CS & AI, Arizona State University. I completed my undergraduate studies majoring in Computer Science from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/), India. I have previously worked and collaborated with research groups at [IIIT, Delhi](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arunb/) and [IIT, Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/) focusing on the topics of Adversarial Machine Learning and incorporating human preferences in Reinforcement Learning domains. My research interests further inlcude making AI models explainable, interpretable and secure; along with learning to incorporate human behavior and preferences in a more dynamic and adaptive way.
