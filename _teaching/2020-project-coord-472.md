I served as the Project Coordinator for the course CSE 472: Social Media Mining, offered by my Ph.D advisor Dr. Huan Liu, in Fall 2020. I was in charge of designing a course project, mentoring and assisting students, and grading the final projects. Project topic I designed: **Machine Generated Text Detection**.
