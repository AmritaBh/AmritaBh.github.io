I was appointed as a CIS Research Aide for Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Mazzola at the W.P. Carey School of Business, ASU. I was responsible for serving as an assistant for the courses **CIS 430: Mobile Platforms for Business**, **CIS 505: Introduction to Enterprise Analytics** and **CIS 506: Information Management**. As part of my duties, I assisted students with assignments, projects and also graded assignments and quizzes.
