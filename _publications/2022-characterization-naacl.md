excerpt: 'In today’s post-truth era, sifting useful information from the plethora of narratives including sensationalistic journalism, spins and opinion pieces has become an extremely difficult task for the average news consumer. Paired with the information overload due to online journalism and our overburdened cognitive resources, we are increasingly susceptible to malicious forms of disinformation that may affect our judgment and in turn, real-life actions. To address this dimension of maliciousness of news articles, in this work, we propose and formalize a new task: Characterizing Harmful Agendas, in the context of journalistic news articles. Given the subjective nature of the task,  we draw insights from journalism subject matter experts and release an evaluation dataset of 506 expert annotated news articles to evaluate work in this area. We further develop an initial characterization system which achieves 72\% accuracy on this dataset.'

**Abstract**: In today’s post-truth era, sifting useful information from the plethora of narratives including sensationalistic journalism, spins and opinion pieces has become an extremely difficult task for the average news consumer. Paired with the information overload due to online journalism and our overburdened cognitive resources, we are increasingly susceptible to malicious forms of disinformation that may affect our judgment and in turn, real-life actions. To address this dimension of maliciousness of news articles, in this work, we propose and formalize a new task: Characterizing Harmful Agendas, in the context of journalistic news articles. Given the subjective nature of the task,  we draw insights from journalism subject matter experts and release an evaluation dataset of 506 expert annotated news articles to evaluate work in this area. We further develop an initial characterization system which achieves 72\% accuracy on this dataset.
