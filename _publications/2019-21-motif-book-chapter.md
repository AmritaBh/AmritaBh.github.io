excerpt: '...In this chapter, we present a perspective of developer interaction using the lensofmotifs. Through a case study using development data from a large real-word sys-tem involving 2000+ individuals and 150000+ units of work, we demonstrate how amotif based view can endow a deeper sense of two of the critical drivers of softwaredevelopment risk–workload and task completion time.
